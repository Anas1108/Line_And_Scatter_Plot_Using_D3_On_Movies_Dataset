# Plotting Scatter and Line Plot Using D3 on Movies Dataset

This project demonstrates how to plot a scatter and line plot using D3.js on a movies dataset. The dataset contains information about movies such as the budget, revenue, and release year. The results are displayed on a web page using HTML and CSS.

## Getting Started

To run this project, you will need to have Node.js installed on your machine. If you don't have it, you can download it from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

Clone this repository to your local machine and navigate to the project directory.

Run the following command in your terminal to install the required dependencies:

- npm install

To start the development server, run the following command:

- npm start

This will open the project in your browser at [http://localhost:1234](http://localhost:1234). The HTML and CSS files define the layout and styles for the plots, which are generated and updated by D3.js.

## Scatter Plot

The scatter plot is a visualization that represents the relationship between two variables. In this project, the scatter plot represents the relationship between the budget and revenue of the movies. The x-axis represents the budget and the y-axis represents the revenue.

## Line Plot

The line plot is a visualization that represents the change in a variable over time. In this project, the line plot represents the change in the average revenue of movies over time. The x-axis represents the year and the y-axis represents the average revenue.

## Conclusion

This project is a great starting point for anyone who wants to learn how to create scatter and line plots using D3.js and display the results on a web page using HTML and CSS. You can use this project as a foundation to build more complex visualizations.
